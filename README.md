# vite-template
This is a simple vite template

Make sure you have node installed

To create the boilerplate do 

```bash
npm create vite
```

And this they will ask you for your project name.

I always go with **client**

And then I use my arrow keys to choose My Framework (React) and press Enter

And I choose my language (Javascript)

When you're done, do 

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

After that you should have a running dev server.

To close do Ctrl + C
